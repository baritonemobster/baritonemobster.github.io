# the whole AdaShima novel series translated into Vietnamese

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I'm going to do it. This project will take years to finish, but I love the series way too much to just not do it. 

I'm uploading the first volume here as soon as I finish translating all of it. I'm probably going to finish it on January. Stay tuned!

(Note: There is already a Vietnamese translation for the first three volumes, but I am still going to translate the whole thing FROM SCRATCH. Don't worry about plagiarism.)

Progress: Volume 1, chapter 2.
